# My Experience with a VCR

By Joel Collazo    3-10-23

When I am home and have some free time I like to watch some movies. So one of the things I bought a while ago was a DVD and VHS combo player. One of the problems that I have with it is using the buttons on the outside in front of the player. So if I don't have the instructions it can get a little bit confusing. One of the great things about it though is that it's able to display an HDMI image to the TV. So that eliminates the problem of using component and RCA cables.

Pulling out one of my vhs's to watch it with the player is what I do from time to time. Using the player to watch a VHS is relatively easy to do but there are a few things that can get in the way. Placing the VHS into the player it will take it and insert it to its drive. Now I should look at the TV and see a problem. The player most of the time by default will automatically go to the DVD drive even if there's nothing in it. So now I have to click on the button that says select a drive. Now this is an example of a mental model because the drives are stacked on top of each other. Next to the select drive button is the display of what drive is selected. So instead of having them horizontal like how the drives are physically they are vertically stacked. So it is not a perfect mental model of what you're looking at physically. This can lead to a little bit of confusion and there is also a third option there for an SD card. Furthermore if you didn't know there was a read SD card function then this can throw you off. So okay now I have the drive selected then there is one more problem.

Now VHS is a physical media that you have to rewind after viewing it. So in this situation I already watched it once and I'm watching it again and forgot to rewind it. Looking at the front interface it is a little bit difficult to see what buttons to press to rewind. Most of the buttons that you have interacted with are on the right side so far. So then to rewind they are the first two buttons on the left closer to the power button. This is really a poor design choice since they do not say rewind or fast forward above them. It makes it harder for the user to understand what button to press to do the action and can lead to random button pressing. There should be a label above the buttons saying fast forward and rewind. Instead they chose to just put more arrows above them.

Okay so moving on to actually playing the VHS. So now this is a much easier and **satisfying** thing to do. Now that it's been rewound and it's ready to be viewed you just click the play button. It is one of the larger buttons in front of the player and even has a little notch on top of it. Since it is the button you're going to press the most it does have a nice click to it. By clicking the play button now of course it just simply plays the VHS out the HDMI to the TV. Finally this is the best part of it all having the highest quality possible from an old VHS tape.

Now finally time to hit play and enjoy the movie. I really do like the Player and the fact that it can display an HDMI image of all the VHS I have in my collection. I have VHS from the 70â€™s from Japan that now looks so crystal clear.

Overall there aren't that many buttons on the outside of the player. But there are some design choices that could have been better. From the point of where it will automatically select the DVD drive is really annoying. Following that by the poor choice of descriptions above the buttons for fast forward and the rewind functions. It is interesting that this was supposed to be a very high end player yet it has these flaws. For the user interface it is good but surely does need some improvements for it to be perfect.
