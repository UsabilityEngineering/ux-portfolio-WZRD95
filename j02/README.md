# My Experience with a VCR Ver. 2.0

By Joel Collazo    5-14-2023

When I got home the other day I was excited to open my newest package from japan. In this package there was a new VHS tape I ordered from Japan. I go to put it in the player and enjoy my latest purchase. As I sat there I noticed the picture was a bit off from my liking hence I wanted to mess with the settings. Only one problem: how do I get to the settings?

My first instinct was to click on the sub menu button then nothing happened. This was confusing since my first instinct was to click on that to go to the menu and fix the settings. This is due to the standards of modern TVs and even phones now have a main menu. Although  that is true for today but back in the day there was really no way to do that. When there is a **standard** it's when a large group of companies adopt an idea that is really easy to use and remember for the user to have. Then after this being my first failed attempt I then tried something else.

When looking at the remote there is another button that says display. Then when I clicked on it again nothing really happened. This is good since I know that if I can't use that button in the menu then nothing happens. This is really bad visibility. It makes me think that there is nothing going on. When there is bad **visibility** like in this case it is because there is no message bar that comes up saying if i can or can't do the action. It is so the user can have feedback for doing the right or wrong thing.



Okay fast forward then now i'm doing something else then it dawns on me what about the functions button. Then after clicking on it it brings up the copy and some other DVR  functions. Then bam could that other functions tab be the one i'm looking for.

Then using this menu it's just like the rest I'm used to using on a daily basis. The good news is that the buttons on the remote are in line with my **mental** **model** of how they are on the menu. When I use the arrow keys on the remote they are laid out in the same direction making it easy to use. From here I go down to the tab labeled other functions in hope this is the setting I've been looking for. After clicking on it a new pop up appears saying settings.

Finally after owning this VCR i can finally mess with the settings here at the new menu there is all the settings i've been looking for. So I go to the display tab and can make sure the output is the right one for me and my setup. Then I also noticed there is a full mode to stretch the VHS video to fit the tv. This is great so i can have subtitles and not lose them on the bottom of the screen. Then luckily the max output is native 1080p so then i'm getting the best picture quality possible

Overall this was not the best user experience. There are a lot of menus that I have to go through when wanting to change one thing. It's not really easy to remember all the steps to get to the destination. Also with the lack of visual cues to know if what I'm doing is the right way to do it. Then it being one of the best players since it has HDMI for all the outputs makes it the very best but it still has its flaws.
